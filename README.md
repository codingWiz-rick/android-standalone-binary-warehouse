## **Overview**

This project aims to provide a set of **standalone binaries** that are statically linked, meaning they do not require additional libraries or dependencies. These binaries are optimized to run on Android devices, making them a lightweight and easy-to-deploy solution for various use cases, such as development, debugging, or testing.

### **Why Statically Linked Binaries?**

* **No Dependencies**: Once you download the binary, you can run it without worrying about external dependencies.
* **Portability**: These binaries can be deployed on any Android device with minimal configuration.
* **Efficiency**: Since the binaries are statically linked, they are more efficient in terms of runtime performance.

---

## **Features**

* **Standalone**: No external libraries required.
* **Precompiled**: Ready to use immediately after download.
* **Cross-version Support**: Designed to work across a range of Android versions and devices.
* **Custom Built**: Each binary is custom-built for specific tasks, ensuring optimized performance.

---

## **Supported Binaries**

The repository includes various binaries such as:

* **Core Utilities**: `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, etc.
* **Network Tools**: `curl`, `wget`, etc.
* **Development Tools**: `gcc`, `g++`, etc.
* **Miscellaneous**: `vim`, `nano`, etc.

> *Note: This list will be continuously updated as more binaries are added.*
